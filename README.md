 <summary><h3> 🪁 My life Journey</h3></summary>
   I'm an open-minded person with experience in programming, 👩🏻‍🔬 chemistry, 👩🏻‍🏫 teaching English and 🎸 playing the guitar as well.
   I started my coding journey with teaching myself C language with a dream to build my own app. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - English teaching career. Also I was getting my Master`s degree in Chemistry at that time. I eventually ended up teaching English to pursue the idea of helping out kids to aquire the foreign language, and that had been my focus for 4 years. I`ve already helped more than 50 people. 
  But there was something that always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app and develop myself over again. Now I`m eager to become a Senior Fullstack Developer. 
  I tend to believe in 10.000-hour concept. As Gladwell tells it, the rule goes like this: it takes 10,000 hours of intensive practice to achieve mastery of complex skills and materials, like playing the violin or getting as good as Bill Gates at computer programming. I reckon that I`m going to become a highly-qualified programmer in about 4 years.
